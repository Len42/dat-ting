# dat-ting

_Multi-function Eurorack module inspired by [dis ting](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/disting.html)_

dat-ting is a digital multi-function 10 HP Eurorack module, based on a [Daisy Seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed) DSP board. Part of my [homebrew Eurorack synthesizer](https://lenp.net/synth/).
